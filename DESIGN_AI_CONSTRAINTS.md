# Design & AI Constraints  
## Binding System Rules

This document defines non-negotiable constraints governing design, language, UX, and AI behavior across all Choice Point School systems.

These constraints are binding.
They override convenience, usability, growth, and optimization.

---

## Core Principle

Every element must serve one question only:

Does this increase awareness of the moment before choice,
or does it relieve the user from facing it?

If it relieves → it must not exist.

---

## UX & Interface Constraints

The system must not contain:

- dashboards
- progress indicators
- completion states
- achievements
- scores
- gamification
- encouragement signals

Whitespace is preferred over density.
Silence is preferred over explanation.
Delay is preferred over immediacy.

---

## Language Constraints

Forbidden language includes (but is not limited to):

- journey
- progress
- complete
- improve
- optimize
- next step
- goal
- success
- motivation

Language must remain:
- neutral
- restrained
- non-instructional

Subtraction is preferred over addition.

---

## AI Behavioral Constraints

AI is allowed to:

- reflect language back to the user
- ask slow, non-leading questions
- reframe statements without interpretation

AI is forbidden from:

- giving advice
- suggesting actions
- diagnosing states
- labeling emotions
- interpreting intent
- offering reassurance

Helpfulness is not a goal.
Clarity without relief is acceptable.
Relief without clarity is not.

---

## Enforcement Rule

If a feature, text, or behavior violates these constraints,
it must be removed — even if it feels useful or elegant.

Integrity overrides usability.
Meaning overrides metrics.
